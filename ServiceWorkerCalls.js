// In Manifest V3, service workers replace the background pages of Manifest V2. The service worker is a type of web worker, a JavaScript file that runs in the background separate from a webpage.

// To create hashed versions of the .js files, you can use build tools like Webpack or Rollup. These tools can be configured to output hashed filenames, which can be useful for cache busting.

// Here's a basic example of how you might configure Webpack to output hashed filenames:



const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};


// In this configuration, [name] is the name of the entry point (or chunk), and [contenthash] is a hash of the content of the output file. Every time the content changes, the hash will change as well.

// Please note that you'll need to install Webpack and set up your project to use it. This is a simplified example and your actual configuration may need to be more complex depending on your project's requirements.


// Specifically, a service worker runs in the background, separate from a web page. It responds to events from pages it controls (like network requests), and it has a lifecycle that's completely separate from web pages. This allows it to handle heavy computations or network requests that might otherwise block the main thread and make the interface unresponsive.

// Service workers are also unique because they can control network requests from your web pages, enabling features like offline support, cache management, and background updates.
