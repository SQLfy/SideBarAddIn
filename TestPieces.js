// To test pieces of functionality in a minimal framework, you can use a unit testing framework. For JavaScript, popular choices include Jest and Mocha. Here's a basic setup using Jest:

// Install Jest using npm (node package manager):
// In your package.json file, add a test script:
// Create a test file. If your file is named myFunction.js, create a new file in the same directory named myFunction.test.js.




const myFunction = require('./myFunction');

test('tests that myFunction does its job', () => {
    expect(myFunction('input')).toBe('expected output');
});

// Create a test file. If your file is named myFunction.js, create a new file in the same directory named myFunction.test.js.

// In myFunction.test.js, import the function you want to test and write a test case:

// Run your tests using the command npm test.
// This is a very basic setup and your actual testing may need to be more complex depending on your application's requirements. For example, you might need to mock certain functions or modules, or you might need to set up a testing database. Jest's documentation is a great resource for learning more about these topics.
